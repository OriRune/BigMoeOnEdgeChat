# The seam: how we hook llama.cpp without forking it

Everything that connects BigMoeOnEdge to llama.cpp goes through two public mechanisms.
This file documents the exact contract so it can be re-verified when the submodule is
updated.

## 1. The eval-callback

`llama_context_params.cb_eval` / `cb_eval_user_data` (public) install a function called by
`ggml_backend_sched` for every graph node:

- `callback(node, ask=true, ud)` is called for each node. Returning true isolates that
  node: the scheduler computes it alone, `ggml_backend_synchronize`s, then calls
  `callback(node, ask=false, ud)`.
- Returning false groups the node with its neighbours for normal computation (no non-ask
  callback).

We use both phases:

**Capture phase** (one warm-up decode). `ask` is called for every node, so we scan each
node's `src[]` for expert weight tensors (`blk.<il>.<suffix>.weight`, where the suffixes
come from the arch's recipe — `ffn_{gate,up,down}_exps` for the split layout, a fused
`ffn_gate_up_exps` for others) and record the live `ggml_tensor*`. We return false
throughout — capture observes, it does not isolate. `ggml_tensor` is a public struct, so
reading `->name`, `->ne`, `->nb` and writing `->data` is public API surface.

**Stream phase** (real generation). We return true for `ffn_moe_topk-<il>`. The
non-ask callback then hands us that node with the selected expert ids materialized; we
gather them (stride-aware) and trigger the slice reads.

Two optional jobs ask for more: the route trace and
[cache-aware dropping](expert-dropping.md) also want each layer's `ffn_moe_weights*-<il>` chain,
which is another barrier per node but no new kind of access — same public struct, same read of
`->data`.

The two lossy routing policies go one step further, and they are the only places the engine
**writes into** a graph tensor's contents rather than repointing `->data` at its own buffer.
Dropping, at the terminal node of the weight chain, zeroes a dropped slot's weight and repoints
that slot's expert id; [substitution](cache-aware-substitution.md), at the `ffn_moe_topk` node,
rewrites the selected ids toward resident experts. In both cases the tensors are scratch the graph
produced and has not yet consumed, so this alters the values flowing through the run —
deliberately, that is what a lossy policy *is* — and never llama.cpp's own state, its weights, or
its control flow. It stays inside the same callback contract; nothing is patched.

## 2. gguf offsets

`gguf_init_from_file(..., no_alloc=true)` + `gguf_get_data_offset` +
`gguf_get_tensor_offset` (all public) give each tensor's absolute byte offset in the file,
without loading any tensor data. We match these to the captured tensors by name.

## 3. The expert-ready hook (fork extension)

Sections 1 and 2 are enough for the *serial* streamer: block on the expert reads, then let
the layer compute. Overlapping the two — reading a token's experts while the same token's
expert matmuls are running — needs a wait point that no public API exposes. That is the one
place where BigMoeOnEdge carries a llama.cpp extension.

**What it is.** A single optional hook, ~25 lines, living on the fork branch
`bmoe/expert-ready-hook` of `Helldez/llama.cpp` as a single commit on top of the upstream
pin. It adds nothing to the model files and changes no data layout; it is a callback the
CPU MoE kernel invokes.

**Exact API and call site.**

```c
// ggml-cpu.h
void ggml_cpu_set_expert_ready_hook(ggml_expert_ready_hook_t hook, void * user_data);
```

`ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat_id` calls the hook at the top of its per-expert loop, right
after the "expert not routed this token" skip, before it consumes that expert's weight
slice. Every compute thread calls it for every routed expert; the hook may block. There is
**no barrier inside the expert loop**, so a thread blocking on one expert cannot deadlock
the threadpool — other threads proceed to the experts whose slices are already resident.
The streamer's hook blocks until the requested expert slice has been read in, then returns.
When no hook is registered (stock upstream, or `--overlap` off) the call is a single null
check — zero cost.

**Why it exists.** The topk eval-callback (section 1) is the only public hook near routing,
and it can only fire *before* the expert matmuls of a layer run — it cannot pause partway
through them. Overlapping expert reads with expert compute requires a per-expert wait point
*inside* the kernel, which the public API does not provide. Hence the extension.

**Graceful degradation.** CMake probes `ggml-cpu.h` for the hook symbol and, when present,
defines `BMOE_HAVE_EXPERT_READY_HOOK`. Built against stock upstream (symbol absent) the
whole project still compiles and runs — the serial streaming path is unchanged; only
`--overlap` is affected, and it fails with a clear runtime error instead of silently
falling back.

**Sunset condition.** This fork exists *solely* for this one hook. The moment upstream
ships an equivalent per-expert readiness/residency callback, the branch is dropped and the
submodule bumps straight back to `ggml-org/llama.cpp`. It is a tide-me-over until the wait
point is public, not a divergence we intend to maintain.

## The chat glue: llama.cpp `common` (not the streaming seam)

Separate from the two streaming hooks above, `session.cpp` links llama.cpp's `common`
library for two things: rendering the model's own chat template and parsing reasoning output, and
(with `--mtp`) driving speculative decoding.
`common_chat_templates_init` / `common_chat_templates_apply` run the real Jinja template the
gguf ships (so Gemma's channel format, Qwen ChatML, etc. all format correctly, driven by the
model rather than hardcoded), and `common_chat_parse` extracts a reasoning model's thinking so
it can be reported apart from the answer. The parser-params wiring lives in its own translation
unit, `chat_parse.cpp` — the PEG parser arena has to be loaded explicitly or `common_chat_parse`
throws on the first token, which is how issue #49 stayed invisible; keeping it separate makes
that seam unit-testable without a model.

A second translation unit, `thinking_control.cpp`, crosses the same boundary for "thinking off".
`enable_thinking` is only a *request* to the template, and many templates never read it, so the
engine renders the template to find out (three renders at open, no model names involved) and, where
the flag is inert *and* reasoning is a structural section of the format, asks for a **continuation**
instead: the `continue_final_message` field of `common_chat_templates_inputs`, plus a synthetic
trailing assistant message, makes llama.cpp's own per-template handler emit that family's "reasoning
is over" span into the prompt. This is why no `<think>` or harmony channel marker appears anywhere in
`core/` — the markers stay upstream, where a submodule bump keeps them current.

`think_budget.cpp` reads the same data (`thinking_start_tag`, `thinking_end_tags`, and the
generation prompt, to tell whether the prompt already opened the span) to cap how long a model may
reason: the closing tag the template declares is tokenized and forced at the sampling point. It does
not use llama.cpp's own reasoning-budget sampler, which lives in `common` and is wired to a server's
sampler setup; the governor is a few lines of policy over the public sampling loop the engine already
owns, and is unit-tested without a model (`tests/think_budget_test.cpp`).

Whether the continuation is *binding* is read off `common_chat_params::thinking_start_tag`/
`thinking_end_tag`: a model that declares a reasoning span owns it, so a pre-closed empty one is a
suggestion it can decline (LFM2.5 does), while a model that declares none separates reasoning
structurally and cannot. Both facts come from the loaded model, never from its name.
`tests/think_control_test.cpp` pins all of it against the vendored templates, again with no model.

### Speculative decoding

Only the MTP source crosses into `common`. The verify half of the loop — the wide batch, the argmax
acceptance, the KV rollback — is written against public `llama.h` alone, and so is the n-gram draft
source, which is why `--ngram` needs nothing from `common` at all. `core/include/bmoe/ngram_draft.h`
does not even include `llama.h`: it is written over `int32_t` token ids, which is what `llama_token`
is, so the drafting policy stays on the pure-policy side of the seam and is unit-tested with no model
and no native backend (`tests/ngram_test.cpp`). See [ngram.md](ngram.md).

`--mtp` reaches `common/speculative.h`, which is a header of the same `common` library and
includes only `llama.h` and `common.h`. The draft/verify orchestration — running the trained MTP
head, moving hidden states from the target to it, seeding the next draft from the accepted position
— is entirely upstream's; the engine supplies the loop around it and the two contexts it works on.
Worth stating explicitly because the internals it needs (`llama_set_embeddings_nextn` and the
`nextn` hidden-state getters) live in `src/llama-ext.h`, a *staging* header: they are used **inside**
`speculative.cpp`, which is already compiled into the `llama-common` the engine links, so nothing in
`core/` includes a private header and no in-tree patch is involved.

What the engine does own is the pair of contexts. Self-speculation is one model with two contexts
over it — the target, and a draft created with `ctx_type = LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_MTP` — and the engine
builds the draft one itself rather than through `common_speculative_init_from_params`, for a reason
that belongs to this project: **the eval callback is per-context**. The streamer only sees the MTP
block's expert layer if the draft context carries the same `cb_eval`, and `init_from_params` derives
its context parameters from a full `common_params` with no way to inject one. See
[mtp.md](mtp.md).

Unlike the public-C-API streaming seam, `common` is **not a stable API** — it can change
between upstream versions. So a submodule bump may require updating this chat glue in
`session.cpp` / `chat_parse.cpp` / `thinking_control.cpp`; the build and gates catch a break at
compile time rather than at runtime (`tests/chat_parse_test.cpp` and
`tests/think_control_test.cpp` and `tests/think_budget_test.cpp` cover these seams directly). This
trade-off is deliberate and is also noted at the link site in the root `CMakeLists.txt`. The
gates themselves run with the template off (raw prompt), so they stay deterministic and are
unaffected by this dependency.

## The one ggml behaviour we depend on

That a node marked "needed" is computed and synchronized **before** the non-ask callback,
and that the batch containing the dependent expert matmul runs **after** the callback
returns. This is how `ggml_backend_sched` implements the eval-callback today
(`ggml/src/ggml-backend.cpp`). It is not a stability-guaranteed contract, so:

- the [byte-identity gates](../tests/moe_gates.cpp) assert lossless output, which fails
  loudly if the ordering ever changes;
- CI runs the gates on every submodule bump.

## Per-graph placement (`--prefill-device`)

The prefill device ([npu-prefill.md](npu-prefill.md)) adds no llama.cpp change, but it leans on these
behaviours of the public surface and two naming conventions. All are exercised by gates G16 and G17,
except where noted:

- **The scheduler assigns a backend per graph, from the weight's buffer.** `ggml_backend_sched` looks
  at each weight's `tensor->buffer` every time it splits a graph, so rebinding `buffer`, `data` and
  `extra` (and, for a weight carried to the device in another type, `type` and `nb`) between graphs
  moves the weight's ops. The rebind happens only between `llama_decode` calls.
- **Graph reuse skips that decision.** A graph shaped like the previous one is reused without being
  re-scheduled, so device graphs and CPU graphs are kept to different widths (`--prefill-min-tokens`).
  A llama.cpp change that reused graphs across shapes would break this; G16 would show it.
- **`ggml_backend_tensor_set` is where a backend lays weights out its own way.** The arena writes each
  expert through a per-expert view, and writes each slot tensor once whole at load so the backend
  records its layout for the tensor the op actually reads.
- **A buffer's usage is what a backend reads to decide how to hold it.** `ggml_backend_buffer_set_usage`
  marks a buffer `WEIGHTS` or not, and a backend may lay out and map a `WEIGHTS` buffer for its
  matmul alone (Hexagon with DMA64 maps it for DMA only, and most of its other kernels then refuse it
  at run time). So the engine marks only the matmul matrices `WEIGHTS` and puts every other layer weight
  (norms, biases, scales), as found from the ops the capture graph applies to it, in plain device
  memory.
- **Two context knobs.** `n_outputs_max` bounds the logit rows the context reserves, and toggling
  `llama_set_causal_attn` off and on makes the next decode redo the compute-buffer reservation, which
  the engine uses once, with the weights on the device, so the CPU does not keep a reservation for a
  graph it never runs.
- **Concurrent uploads into one buffer.** The arena's loader threads call `ggml_backend_tensor_set`
  on different views of the same slot buffer at once. ggml does not document this as thread-safe; it
  holds for the CPU, RPC and Hexagon backends today because each write touches only its own bytes.
  The gates cover the CPU (through RPC); on the NPU only a device run does.
- **Layer weights are named `blk.N.`** The engine selects the weights it moves by that prefix. It is
  the GGUF tensor naming every architecture in llama.cpp uses, not an API: a model that named its
  layers otherwise would keep them on the CPU, correct but not faster.
- **Model state tensors are named `cache_`.** The capture tells the KV and recurrent state apart from
  weights by the `cache_` prefix llama.cpp's memory modules give them, so the prefill can place the
  state where both sides can address it. That prefix is internal naming: if upstream renamed it the
  state would stay in CPU memory, again correct but slower, and `prefill_dev_nodes` in the telemetry
  would drop. Check it on each bump.
- **With no devices given, llama.cpp picks them.** `llama_model_params::devices` left null lists every
  GPU-type device (integrated ones only when no discrete one is found), and the context opens a
  backend on each, layers or not. Without `--prefill-device` the engine keeps that choice, except that
  it drops a device whose capabilities (`host_buffer`, `buffer_from_host_ptr`) say it cannot reach
  host memory, and then passes the rest explicitly, repeating that integrated-device rule. If upstream
  changed its selection, only a build carrying such a device (Hexagon) would see the difference. Not
  gated: the host build has no such device.
- **A device that fails to open throws.** Hexagon opens its DSP session in `ggml_backend_dev_init`
  and throws when it cannot. The engine calls it once before the load, catches that, and keeps the run
  on the CPU; the backend caches the session, so the context's own init reuses it.

## Upgrading llama.cpp

Because the submodule pins the `bmoe/expert-ready-hook` fork branch (section 3), a bump
rebases that 1-commit branch onto the new upstream tag, re-pushes it, and re-pins:

```bash
# in a Helldez/llama.cpp checkout: rebase the single hook commit onto the new tag
git fetch upstream && git checkout bmoe/expert-ready-hook
git rebase <newer-upstream-tag> && git push --force-with-lease origin bmoe/expert-ready-hook

# in this repo: move the submodule to the rebased commit, rebuild, run the gates
cd third_party/llama.cpp && git fetch origin && git checkout <rebased-commit>
cd ../.. && git add third_party/llama.cpp && scripts/build-host.sh
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure     # gates must stay green
```

When the sunset condition lands (upstream ships the readiness callback) this collapses back
to a plain `git checkout <newer-tag>` against `ggml-org/llama.cpp` with no branch to carry.
Either way the gates are the enforcement. The fragility is not the public
API but the *internal naming conventions* the seam attaches to — the tensor suffixes and
the `ffn_moe_topk` node name are how llama.cpp happens to build MoE graphs today, not a
guaranteed contract, so upstream can rename or restructure them (Gemma 4's fused
`ffn_gate_up_exps` is one such evolution we absorbed with a recipe row). The gates are the
enforcement: a rename breaks byte-identity before merge instead of silently corrupting
output. Each supported architecture adds one more gate to keep green across a bump.

If a future release moves the two hooks (a stable expert-residency API, say) upstream,
this seam shrinks further or disappears — `core/` does not change.

Pinned submodule at the time of writing: `Helldez/llama.cpp` branch
`bmoe/expert-ready-hook-2609`, commit `dce9698`: the single expert-ready-hook commit
(section 3) on top of upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp` master `965f897` of 2026-09-26 (530 commits
past `b10666`). On this base upstream's CPU `mul_mat_id` has a tiled path that reads an expert
before the classic loop does, so the hook fires ahead of it; G4 is what proves it still gates
every read. Each bump gets its own fork branch and the
previous ones stay, so every commit an old pin names remains reachable (see `.gitmodules` /
`git submodule status` for the current pin).

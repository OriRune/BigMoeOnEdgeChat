# Session mode

A fresh `bmoe-cli` process per prompt re-pays two fixed costs every time: the model load (tens
of seconds for a >RAM model) and the expert-cache warm-up ramp (the LRU cache starts empty, so
the first tokens miss often and read far more from flash than the steady state — see
[benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md)). Streaming was meant to avoid exactly this kind of repeated work.

Session mode amortises both. `Session` (`core/include/bmoe/session.h`) loads the model, discovers
the MoE expert tensors, and initialises the expert source **once**; each `generate()` then runs a
prompt against that resident state, and the expert LRU cache **survives between calls**, so a
second prompt starts warm.

```cpp
std::string err;
auto s = Session::open(cfg, err);      // model load + capture + source.init — once
s->generate({.prompt = "..."});        // prefill + decode; cache filled
s->generate({.prompt = "..."});        // starts warm — no reload, no cold ramp
```

`run()` (`runtime.h`) is a thin one-shot wrapper over `Session` — open, one generate, close — so
the byte-identity gates exercise the same machinery an interactive session uses. Gates **S1/S2**
assert that a second, warm generate produces output identical to the cold one-shot reference:
warming the cache changes latency, never the bytes.

## Independent prompts vs multi-turn chat

`GenerateRequest::clear_kv` selects between two modes:

- **`true` (new chat / independent prompt):** the KV cache and the engine-held conversation are
  dropped before the prompt runs. The expert cache stays warm. This is the one-shot path — `run()`
  always uses it, and the byte-identity gates exercise it.
- **`false` (continue):** the prompt continues the current conversation. In chat mode the Session
  owns the conversation (`chat_history`) and re-renders the model's chat template over the *whole*
  history each turn, so the caller sends only the new user message — not the running transcript.

**KV prefix reuse.** Re-rendering the full history would re-tokenize the entire conversation, but
most of it is already decoded into the KV. Each turn the engine diffs the freshly rendered tokens
against `kv_tokens` (the tokens currently in the KV, in order), keeps the common prefix, removes the
divergent tail with `llama_memory_seq_rm`, and prefills only the suffix. So a follow-up turn pays
for its own tokens, not a full re-prefill — which matters because prefill is the slow phase on
device. `BMOE_DONE.n_prompt` reports the tokens actually prefilled this turn; `n_past` is the total
context length after it.

**Fallbacks and costs.** SWA-style memory (e.g. Gemma) can refuse a partial `seq_rm`; the engine
then clears the KV and re-prefills the whole prompt for that turn (correct, just slower). With
thinking **on**, the template strips the previous turn's reasoning on re-render, so the rendered
prefix diverges at the last answer and up to one answer's worth of tokens is re-prefilled per turn;
with thinking **off** (the app default) the re-fed suffix is just the new user turn plus a few
wrapper tokens.

### Seeding a saved conversation

A front-end whose own store is the source of truth (a chat database, an edited or retried turn)
should not have to remember what the engine holds. `GenerateRequest::replace_history` with
`history` (a list of `{role, content}`, roles `system`, `user` or `assistant`) replaces the
engine-held conversation before this turn's user message is appended; `prompt` is still only the
new message. Nothing is cleared for it: the KV prefix diff above does the work, so re-sending
exactly what the session already holds costs nothing beyond the new turn, and a different history
re-prefills from the first token that differs. Send `clear_kv:true` with it to start from an empty
KV (a conversation loaded from storage); `clear_kv:false` to keep whatever prefix still matches
(the usual turn, with the history re-sent). Chat mode only: without `--chatml` the request is
refused, as is an unknown role, and in both cases the session is left as it was.

An assistant message seeded from an earlier answer re-tokenizes to the tokens the engine decoded
when the text round-trips, so the seeded and the live conversation produce the same next answer and
the same `n_past` (gate G19a). Models that reason and strip the previous turn's thinking on
re-render already pay for that divergence each turn (see above); seeding does not change it. A
hybrid stack with a recurrent state cannot be rewound to the middle of a conversation, so it
re-prefills each turn either way.

`fit_ctx:true` makes an overflowing request fit instead of failing: while the rendered prompt plus
`n_predict` would exceed `n_ctx`, the oldest exchange goes (the first non-system message and every
message after it up to the next `user` message), the prompt is rendered again, and
`RunResult::history_dropped` counts the messages removed. System messages stay, and so does the
turn's own user message; when nothing more can go, the usual non-fatal overflow error is returned.
The dropped messages are gone from the engine's conversation too, so a caller that keeps its own
record should re-send it in full next time and let `fit_ctx` trim it again.

**Reasoning is returned, not discarded.** On a thinking model the Session parses the reasoning span
out of the raw stream and carries it in its own field (`TokenMetrics`/`RunResult::reasoning`,
`delta_reasoning` on `BMOE_PROGRESS`, `reasoning` on `BMOE_DONE`) rather than dropping it. The answer text stays free of
it either way, so the byte-identity gates are unaffected; a caller that wants to show the thinking
reads the separate field. The parser wiring lives in `core/src/engine/chat_parse.cpp`
(see [seam.md](seam.md)).

## Cancel

`Session::cancel()` is thread-safe and interrupts an in-flight `generate()` at the next decode
boundary via llama's abort callback (installed unconditionally at open, so it works in serial and
overlap alike). It leaves the model and cache intact; the returned `RunResult` has `cancelled =
true`. In chat mode a cancel **rolls the turn back** to the reused prefix (dropping this turn's KV
and un-appending the user message) so prior turns stay usable and the conversation can continue.
Cancel is distinct from a fatal streaming error, which is sticky and ends the session.

## Thinking budget

A reasoning model can spend a whole reply budget inside its reasoning and never answer, and the common
templates (Qwen3.x, Gemma 4) read only an on/off flag, so there is no "low effort" to request.
`GenerateRequest::think_budget` therefore limits the tokens inside the model's reasoning span: when it
has run that long the engine forces the span's closing tag and the model continues past it, into its
answer. `Session::end_thinking()` makes the same cut at once (thread-safe, like `cancel()`; it is
cleared at the start of every `generate()`, and does nothing once the span has closed). The result
reports `RunResult::thinking_cut` and `thinking_tokens`, and the answer is committed to the history
with the shortened reasoning like any other turn.

`n_predict` counts every generated token, reasoning included, so a caller that wants an answer of up to
A tokens after at most T tokens of thinking sends `n_predict = T + A`. The cut waits for the end of a
multi-byte character, and speculative drafting pauses while the tag is written, so the tag itself is
never drafted past; a group of drafts already in flight can overshoot the budget by up to
`draft_max` tokens. With think off, with no budget and no request, or on a model whose template
declares no reasoning span, nothing changes.

## Fixed context

`n_ctx` and `n_batch` are baked into the llama context at `open()`, before any prompt is known, so
size them for the longest prompt + generation the session will serve. A request that would overflow
`n_ctx` is rejected without tearing the session down, unless it asked for `fit_ctx` (above).

## CLI and app

`bmoe-cli --session` exposes this over a line protocol (requests on stdin, `BMOE_*` responses on
stdout — see [telemetry.md](telemetry.md)). The Android example runs one such process per model:
the first prompt loads the model, later prompts reuse the warm process, and the session is freed on
an explicit **Unload** or after an idle timeout. Changing the model or any streaming setting
reopens the session; changing only the prompt, `n_predict`, or the thinking toggle does not.
